    "Given that the SIPRI Arms Transfers Database contains information on all transfers of major conventional arms, the phenomenon our group is interested in exploring are patterns in international arms transfers, specifically modeling how weapons flow from country to country. The sale, transfer, and flow of weapons represents more than just a one-off relationship between two countries looking to make a deal. These transactions often act as part of a larger network of international trade, rooted in the politics, international relations, and global security of the world. As the data base covers these transactions since 1950, the world today represents a compeltely different place than the one people experienced just a mere 75 years ago. These sales are often used as catalysts and projections of major geopolitical influence, and as a result, our group will look to use features in the data itself to explore topics like changes in political influence such as the height of the Cold War and subsequent fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Middle East conflicts of the 2000s, and even the rise of Chinese influence in Southeast Asia and the rest of the world over the last 10-15 years. To best understand these impacts, our group decided to conduct some exploratory data analysis before building any non-parametric models."
