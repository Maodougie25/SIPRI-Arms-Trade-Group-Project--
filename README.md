# SIPRI Arms Trade Group Project

By: Mauricio Torres, Jeffrey Zhang, Steve Ferenzi, Jack Joy, Weston Williams, Andrew Pavlak, Sammy Aridi

## Overview
This project uses data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Arms Transfers Database to analyze global arms trade patterns. We want to see how the United States' involvement in foreign wars impacts the imports and distribution of weapons and arms trade before, during, and after conflict. Specifically, how might patterns in model-based predictions that arose as a result of the Vietnam War (1970s) be used to analyze similarities and differences in the War on Terror in Afghanistan (2001-2021)?
